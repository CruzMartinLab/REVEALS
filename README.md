Repository for multi camera acquisition software REVEALS


REVEALS (Rodent BEhaVior Multi-camErA Laboratory AcquiSition) is a graphical user interface (GUI) for acquiring rodent behavioral data via commonly used USB3 cameras. Currently REVEALS supports FLIR cameras. REVEALS allows for user-friendly control of recording from one or multiple cameras simultaneously while streamlining the data acquisition process, enabling researchers to collect and analyze large datasets efficiently.

In order to use the packaged windows application, please download the zipped
